		<h1>Hyperautomation</h1>
		<p>Hyperautomation brings together several components of process automation, integrating tools and technologies that amplify the ability to automate work.<br>It starts with robotic automation (RPA) as its core, and expands automation capability with artificial intelligence (AI), process mining, analytics, and other advanced tools. The idea is to automate more and more knowledge work, and engage everyone in an organisation to be part of the transformation. Hyperautomation builds on the momentum behind RPA, led by the democratization of automation and IT and accelerated by the liberation of mudane and repetitive tasks for workers across every industry. In many ways, hyperautomation is redefining work. Hyperautomation builds on the real success that underlies the phenomenal growth of RPA: ease of automation, speed to outcomes, and a now proven path to applying artificial intelligence (AI) to improve business operations. RPA has delivered digital transformation faster than any other technology by starting with the business first and foremost.</p>

	<!-- Multiexperience -->
		<br><h1>Multiexperience</h1>
		<p>Multiexperience refers to the various permutations (e.g., touch, voice and gesture), devices and apps that users interact with on their digital journey across the various touchpoints. Multiexperience development involves creating fit-for-purpose apps based on touchpoint-specific modalities, while at the same time ensuring a consistent user experience across the web, mobile, wearable, conversational and immerisve touchpoints. Multiexperience development platforms (MXDPs) help enterprises to rapidly scale their applications across a range of devices and platforms. MXDPs can help you develop a single application that can be deployed on a variety of devices. This greatly shortens down your efforts and gives brands more control over their digital experiences.</p>

	<!--Distributed Cloud -->
		<br><h1>Distributed Cloud</h1>
		<p>Distributed Cloud is the application of cloud computing technologies to interconnect data and applications served from multiple geographic locations. While distributed computing spreads computation workload across multiple, interconnected servers, distributed cloud computing generalizes this to the cloud infrastructure itself. A distributed cloud is an execution environment where the application components are placed at appropriate geographically-dispersed location chosen to meet the requirements of the application. Such requirements include: location, regulations, security and redundancy. The distributed cloud service provider ensures the end-to-end management for the optimal placement of data, computing processes, and network interconnections based on the above mentioned requirements. And it appears as a single solution from the cloud user's point of view.</p>
